# Neural-net-using-numpy-with-2-hidden-layers
Neural network using only numpy and 2 hidden layers . Sample code . Needs dataset.


The code hrere uses numpy .
Implements Forward prop , back prop , gradient descent and calculates final wieghts for all layers.

This is only a a sample code , but can function if dataset file is provided as input .
